# Sales Analysis using PowerBi

- The purpose of the project was to better understand the customer base and identify trends in sales revenue.
- Sales data was collected from a company database covering a three-year period.
- Power BI was used to create visualizations, including bar charts, scatter plots, and maps, to analyze the data.
- One challenge was cleaning and preparing the data, but it was overcome with the use of data cleansing tools in Power BI.
- The analysis will be used in the future to monitor sales trends and make data-driven business decisions.
